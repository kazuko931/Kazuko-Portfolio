    ## How it started  
    <p>
    So Me and my friends play this game Called League of Legends, I know  socker. But around The january of 2023 Riot devided to IP lock the main server we were playing on Which forced us to try other games to pass our free time. Not so long after I had the brilliant **Idea** to Run a local minecraft server for me and my friends.

    ## What I learned from the project
    <p>
    The project Gave me an excuse to re-visit ubuntu server and tinker with it further more. The most important concept I learned from this was creating a **Tunnel** network especially a private one Which allowed me to access my server from anywhere as long as I am connected to the same tunnel network using SSH and ZeroTier.
